## Introduction

When I built [rifftales.net](http://rifftales.net), I rolled my own authentication system from scratch. I did this because I knew exactly what I wanted: a simple setup with no external services, no third-party integrations, and full control over the data model. It also turned out to be a great learning exercise - handling sessions, implementing passwordless flows, and thinking through edge cases gave me a much deeper understanding of how authentication actually works.

That said, building custom authentication isn't always the right choice.

For applications requiring production-ready, scalable, and feature-rich authentication without reinventing the wheel, [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) is a strong alternative. It's a complete authentication and user management solution that can be integrated into applications with minimal setup.

With Clerk:

- Accounts can be created and the library installed
- Prebuilt UI components for sign-in/sign-up can be integrated
- User management, SSO, and security features are available out of the box

It essentially eliminates the need to build and maintain custom authentication systems.

**Demo**

The following videos demonstrate Clerk in action:

## Android

&nbsp;
## Setup (Next.js)

I'm using Next.js here, but Clerk supports multiple frameworks.

**Create the app**

```bash
npm create next-app@latest clerk-nextjs -- --yes
cd clerk-nextjs
npm install
```

**Install Clerk**

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

**Middleware setup (important)**

A middleware file should be created to integrate Clerk into the application:

```ts
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default clerkMiddleware()

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and static files
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```
**What this does**

- Runs Clerk on incoming requests
- Ensures authentication context is available everywhere
- Skips static assets for performance

&nbsp;
## Protecting routes

Specific routes can be protected using Clerk's middleware helpers:

```ts
const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) await auth.protect()
})
```

This will:

- Require login for `/dashboard` and `/forum`
- Automatically redirect unauthenticated users

&nbsp;
## Page-level protection

Pages can also be protected individually instead of using middleware.  Here is an example of using the `currentUser` helper to check if the user is signed in:

```tsx
import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default async function ProfilePage() {
  const user = await currentUser();

  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-[70vh] flex-col items-center justify-center px-6 py-12 text-center">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-50">
        Profile
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
        A simple profile page powered by Clerk.
      </p>

      {!user ? (
        <div className="mt-10 flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          <p className="max-w-sm text-sm text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
            Authentication is required. The sign in button in the header should be used to proceed.
          </p>
        </div>
      ) : (
```

**Running the app**

Run the app on (localhost:3000):

A sign-in/sign-up button has been added to the UI.

Clicking Sign Up takes redirects to:

![Screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx8d5hlk1/image/upload/v1773930244/2_pp7vqb.png)

Users can:

- Sign up with Google
- Use email/password
- Add more providers via the Clerk dashboard

&nbsp;
## Clerk dashboard

Once users sign up, they can be managed in the dashboard:

![Screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx8d5hlk1/image/upload/v1773930244/3_tdmrdw.png)

Features include:

- Viewing users
- Deleting or banning accounts
- Monitoring activity

Additional options include:

- Multiple SSO providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) can be added from the dashboard

&nbsp;
## Mobile support

Clerk isn't just for web apps. It also supports:

- React Native
- Expo
- iOS (Swift)
- Android (Kotlin)
- Flutter

This enables:

- Centralized authentication across platforms
- Shared users, roles, and permissions
- Consistent authentication across web and mobile applications

&nbsp;
## Summary

Clerk provides:

- Prebuilt authentication UI
- Secure session handling
- User management dashboard
- SSO and social login support
- Cross-platform support

Building authentication from scratch remains a valuable learning exercise. However, for teams prioritizing rapid feature development, Clerk significantly reduces implementation complexity.
